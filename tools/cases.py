"""The fixed case set used by the smoke test and by the numerical-equivalence gate.

It is deliberately awkward: all three question types, option counts from 2 to 12, English,
German and Hindi states, a JSON state and a conversation-array state. Twenty-two questions in
total across seven calls, which is enough to exercise every temperature bucket the checkpoints
carry a calibration for.
